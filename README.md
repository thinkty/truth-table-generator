# truth-table-generator
Just a simple truth table generator (Don't expect too much :D)

## What is this?
This is a truth table generator that I made to study logic gates. I recommend using this to check your answer.

## How to use it
Download the "main.js" file and open it using your editor. Write the expression you want to check in the main function. Make sure to follow the same format as the examples in the main function. (I only programmed + and * so keep that in mind). Pass the expression as an argument to the "calculate" function. The calculate function will return the result and it is up to the user to decide how to handle the result. (console.log it or save it etc...) I just made it print on the terminal as a table for now.
